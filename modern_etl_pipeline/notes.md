# AWS Glue vs Databricks vs dbt
### 1. **Transformation Complexity and Modularity**
   - **Scenario**: Create a multi-step transformation workflow with reusable components.
   - **Test**: Implement the same transformation logic (e.g., data cleansing, joins, aggregations) using:
     - **AWS Glue**: Use PySpark scripts for transformations.
     - **Databricks**: Use Databricks Notebooks with SQL/PySpark.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt models with SQL.
   - **Goal**: Compare ease of development, reusability of code (modularity), and maintainability.

### 2. **Version Control and Collaboration**
   - **Scenario**: Simulate a collaborative workflow where multiple team members update and modify transformation logic.
   - **Test**: Implement Git integration and version control in:
     - **Glue Jobs**: Check for ease of collaboration and rollback functionality.
     - **Databricks**: Utilize Databricks Repos for version control.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt's inherent Git integration and collaboration features.
   - **Goal**: Assess the ease of collaboration, merge conflicts, and ability to track changes.

### 3. **Data Lineage and Documentation**
   - **Scenario**: Track data lineage and generate documentation for a set of data transformations.
   - **Test**: Check how each tool provides visibility into how data is transformed and the metadata:
     - **Glue**: Explore Glue's built-in data catalog and metadata features.
     - **Databricks**: Test Databricks Unity Catalog or notebooks for lineage.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt's data lineage and automatic documentation features (`dbt docs`).
   - **Goal**: Measure how clear and automatic the lineage is for auditing and troubleshooting.

### 4. **Data Quality and Testing**
   - **Scenario**: Set up data quality tests and validate the transformed data at each step.
   - **Test**: Create assertions to check for null values, unique constraints, and custom data quality tests.
     - **Glue**: Implement data validation checks using PySpark.
     - **Databricks**: Use Databricks SQL or external libraries for validation.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt's built-in testing functionality to test data at each transformation step.
   - **Goal**: Compare how easy it is to implement and maintain data quality checks.

### 5. **Environment Management and Deployment**
   - **Scenario**: Test how easily each tool manages environments (dev, staging, production) and deployment.
   - **Test**:
     - **Glue**: Test with Glue jobs, checking for deployment and environment variables.
     - **Databricks**: Use Databricks workspaces and job clusters.
     - **dbt**: Test dbt's environment management via `profiles.yml` and its deployment via CI/CD.
   - **Goal**: Determine how each tool handles environment isolation and the ease of deployment.

### 6. **Cost and Resource Management**
   - **Scenario**: Measure the cost of running a large-scale transformation and compare resource consumption.
   - **Test**: Run a large ETL pipeline processing large datasets (e.g., 1TB or more) and track the cost for each tool:
     - **Glue**: Measure AWS Glue job costs and cluster scaling.
     - **Databricks**: Test job scaling and cost in Databricks.
     - **dbt**: While dbt itself doesn't compute, measure the underlying compute engine's cost (whether using Redshift, Snowflake, or another compute).
   - **Goal**: Compare resource efficiency, job run times, and cost for each tool.

### 7. **Schema Changes and Evolution**
   - **Scenario**: Handle schema changes (e.g., new columns added to source data).
   - **Test**: Introduce schema changes to the source data and evaluate how each tool handles them.
     - **Glue**: Use Glue's dynamic frames or ETL scripts to handle evolving schemas.
     - **Databricks**: Test Delta Lake’s ability to handle schema evolution.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt's approach to schema changes with version control and refactoring.
   - **Goal**: Compare each tool's flexibility and ease of handling schema changes.

### 8. **Real-Time Streaming vs Batch**
   - **Scenario**: Test the ability to handle real-time streaming data.
   - **Test**: Compare how Glue, Databricks, and dbt handle streaming data:
     - **Glue**: Test Glue Streaming ETL.
     - **Databricks**: Use Spark Structured Streaming.
     - **dbt**: dbt focuses primarily on batch transformations—test if and how it can complement streaming use cases.
   - **Goal**: Identify gaps in real-time data processing capability, especially for dbt.

### 9. **Incremental Data Loads**
   - **Scenario**: Load and transform only the incremental data from a large dataset.
   - **Test**: Implement incremental data processing:
     - **Glue**: Use Glue job bookmarks or custom logic to handle incremental loads.
     - **Databricks**: Use Delta Lake’s incremental processing features.
     - **dbt**: Use dbt’s built-in `incremental` materialization to handle partial loads.
   - **Goal**: Compare efficiency, configuration complexity, and robustness of incremental data processing.

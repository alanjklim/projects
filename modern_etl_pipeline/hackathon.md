Given that the data is staged in S3 before using AWS Glue, here’s the revised flow:

### Revised Plan:

1. **Create synthetic CMI data using Python**.
2. **Load synthetic data into AWS Postgres RDS**.
3. **Stage the synthetic data from RDS to AWS S3**.
4. **Use AWS Glue to transform the staged data from S3** into Boolean flags based on the campaign analytics team’s criteria.
5. **Send the transformed data from AWS S3 to Pega's S3**.
6. **Pega API consumes data from Pega's S3**.
7. **Pega API communicates with Bankwest Android app API** to send notifications (nudges) based on the transformed data.
8. **Bankwest Android App API sends data to Adobe CMS** for additional content management.

### Revised Mermaid Code:

    end

    H --> X
```

This revised flow stages the data in S3, where AWS Glue processes it, and then continues with the data being sent to Pega for further action. This structure reflects your plan better and maintains the logic of using S3 as an intermediary step. Does this updated version work for you?

Here’s a draft pitch deck structure for your PowerPoint presentation on the hackathon, complete with slide suggestions and talking points. You can adapt this for your speech as well.

---

### **Slide 4: The Problem: Missed Notifications**
**Title**: The Problem: Missed Customer Notifications  
**Talking Points**:
- During the COVID-19 lockdown, some Bankwest customers did not receive critical notifications (branch closures).
- A breach of regulatory requirements as a bank. 
- Potential for inappropriate notifications during sensitive times (e.g., bushfires).
- The goal was to build a smarter notification system that would prevent these issues.

---

### **Slide 5: Hackathon Solution Overview**
**Title**: Hackathon Solution Overview  
**Talking Points**: 
- Designed a data pipeline to ensure targeted and intelligent customer notifications.
- Integrated multiple platforms: AWS RDS, S3, Glue, and the Pega decisioning platform.
- Leveraged synthetic data to simulate real-world campaigns (new products, birthdays, disaster alerts, etc.).
- **Key goal**: Ensure customers receive timely, relevant notifications based on circumstances.

---

### **Slide 6: Technical Process Flow**
**Title**: Technical Process Flow  
**Talking Points**:
- High-level view of the end-to-end flow (Python > RDS > S3 > Glue > Pega > Bankwest Android App).
- **Process Summary**:
  1. Create synthetic CMI data in Python.
  2. Load data into AWS Postgres RDS.
  3. Stage data to S3 for processing.
  4. Use AWS Glue to transform data into Boolean flags for campaign targeting.
  5. Send transformed data to Pega’s S3 for intelligent decisioning.
  6. Pega API interacts with Bankwest Android App to send nudges and with Adobe CMS for content management.

---

### **Slide 7: Process Flow Diagram**
**Title**: Process Flow Diagram  
**Talking Points**:
